### Hi there 👋
I am a software developer in Python. At the moment I am preparing a lot of interesting things. In the meantime, you yourself can familiarize yourself with what I use in my work.

Here are some resources to get you started:

- 😄 Solidity https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.16/
- 🐍 Python https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart/
